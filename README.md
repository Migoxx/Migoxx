## Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Alex**](https://github.com/Migoxx), a Junior developer based in Germany.

Currently studying IT and learning programming fundamentals. 
I’m especially curious about web development and love experimenting to create lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless

Outside of coding, you’ll find me listening to techno, cooking or hitting the gym.😅



### Currently Learning🌱 

- HTML, CSS & JavaScript, C#,

- Arduino



### Fun Facts🎲 

I enjoy both coffee ☕ and tea 🍵.

I love watching movies 🎬 and anime 📺.

Techno music 🎶 is my go-to for focus and energy.
